# Your Task
Follow the "User Instruction" (which may include objective advice considering reduction percentages for expense items) and provide concrete analysis and advice from a professional perspective.

At the end of your advice, you must include a "Summary Table of Reduction Proposals".

## Strict Rules
1.  **List Only Reduction Items:**
    In the "Summary Table of Reduction Proposals," **list only the items you propose for reduction (items where the target reduction amount is greater than 0).** Do not include items that are not being reduced.
2.  **Calculate Ratios:**
    Based on the "Consultant's Financial Data," calculate and derive the reduction proposals (ratios and amounts) for the consultant from scratch.
    * `Reduction Ratio (Ratio)` must be calculated as (Reduction Amount ÷ Current Amount) and shown as a real number **rounded to the 6th decimal place** (e.g., **0.33333**).
    * `Reduction Ratio (%)` must be calculated as (Reduction Amount ÷ Current Amount) * 100 and displayed **to the 3rd decimal place** (e.g., 33.333%).
